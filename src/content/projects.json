				"A static personal portfolio website to showcase projects,  work experiences, and blogs.",

				"It&#39;s been almost 3 years since I have launched <a class=\"paragraph-links\" href=\"https://nsp.surge.sh/\">v1.0.0</a> of my personal portfolio site. At that time, I was heavily  involved with building single-page applications w/ React.  So, even for a simple static website like a portfolio, I  went overboard and built it as a SPA. Looking back at it, I  realized there was no need to complicate building static  websites. That can be achieved pretty easily with a few  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Thus, I decided to redesign  the UI and keep the architecture simple to make future  updates easy and more manageable. Unlike v1.0.0, I also  added end-to-end UI testing with Cypress and also set up a  CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate tests and  deployment on code changes."

				"A personal journal for keeping track of all your trades online.",

				"A friend  reached out to me to ask for an application that he wants to  use to log daily stock trades. I found the idea fairly  simple to implement as it seemed very similar to any other  note or record tracking software. Thus, I felt the need to  jump on it right away. I didn&#39;t want to spend too much time  building out the entire application, specially handling APIs  and databases, so I decided to go with a firebase database  to store stock trades on the backend. As for user  authentication, firebase authentication also came in handy  as well. This way, I was able to focus more on the client  side and build a responsive, playful UI with React",

				"As of  October 17, 2021, LogTrade <a class=\"paragraph-links\" href=\"https://github.com/npranto/logtrade/releases/tag/v1.0.0\">v1.0.0</a> is <a class=\"paragraph-links\" href=\"https://logtrade.netlify.app/home/\">live</a> in production. More potential bug-fixes and feature enhancements will be added pretty soon. Also, I do have  plans to release v2.0.0 early to mid 2022"

I wanted to build a small  utility library to verify many different types of inputs  with regexes, so I never have to reach out to google to find  the same, trustworthy regex every time. Currently, I do not  have an exhaustive list of all the regexes there are, but I  have plans to add more and more over time. Regexer is a node package that can be installed for both server-side and client-side use."
