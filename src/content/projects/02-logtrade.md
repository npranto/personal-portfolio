  <span class="font-semibold">Motivation:</span> A friend
  reached out to me to ask for an application that he wants to
  use to log daily stock trades. I found the idea fairly
  simple to implement as it seemed very similar to any other
  note or record tracking software. Thus, I felt the need to
  jump on it right away. I didn&#39;t want to spend too much time
  building out the entire application, specially handling APIs
  and databases, so I decided to go with a firebase database
  to store stock trades on the backend. As for user
  authentication, firebase authentication also came in handy
  as well. This way, I was able to focus more on the client
  side and build a responsive, playful UI with React
