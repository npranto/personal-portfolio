  <span class="font-semibold">Motivation:</span>
  It&#39;s been almost 3 years since I have launched
  <a
  class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500"
  href="https://nsp.surge.sh/"
  >v1.0.0</a
  >
  of my personal portfolio site. At that time, I was heavily
  involved with building single-page applications w/ React.
  So, even for a simple static website like a portfolio, I
  went overboard and built it as a SPA. Looking back at it, I
  realized there was no need to complicate building static
  websites. That can be achieved pretty easily with a few
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Thus, I decided to redesign
  the UI and keep the architecture simple to make future
  updates easy and more manageable. Unlike v1.0.0, I also
  added end-to-end UI testing with Cypress and also set up a
  CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate tests and
  deployment on code changes.
