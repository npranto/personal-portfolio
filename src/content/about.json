				"I am Nazmuz (Shakib) Pranto, a front-end engineer with hands-on  experience building single and multi-page web applications. I'm  passionate about crafting clean, responsive, reusable user interfaces with modern technologies including <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\"    target=\"_blank\" class=\"paragraph-links\">React</a>, <a href=\"https://redux.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paragraph-links\">Redux</a>, and <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\"  class=\"paragraph-links\">Next.js</a>. I also love creating products that serve instant value to customers.",

				"Over the past few years, I had the honor of helping build a highly  customizable eCommerce platform as an engineer at Newfold Digital.  This, in return, accelerated development time and feature delivery for multiple client-side teams within the organization. On the side, I also built and published mini utility libraries and APIs using <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\" target=\"_blank\"  class=\"paragraph-links\"> Node.js</a> for external use.",

				"Currently, I am learning techniques to better architect client-side  applications to deliver more reliability and performance. So, if you  are looking for a front-end focused developer who can improve developer experience, create dynamic user interfaces, and collaborate effectively, feel free to <a href=\"#contact\" class=\"paragraph-links\"> reach out!</a>"

				"I started my journey in web development during my first year of college as a Computer Science student. I was learning HTML and CSS for the very first time, not through a college course though, but on an online learning platform called - <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\"    target=\"_blank\" class=\"paragraph-links\">Codeacademy</a>. I found that to be way more fun and practical than the college courses I was taking back then. Thus, I continued with it and pushed to learn even more on the side. Eventually, I fell in love with it so much that I took the risk of taking time off from college and fully dedicated my time to a software engineering immersive program called <a href=\"https://devmountain.com/\" target=\"_blank\"  class=\"paragraph-links\">DevMountain</a>.",

				"I always believed that I was a go-getter who loves taking risks to improve and get better progressively. That's why I pursued an alternative track to higher education. While I understand the importance of traditional computer science education with a heavy theoretical learning approach, I don't think it's enough for diving into real-world problems in the most effective way. We need more hands-on, practical, project-based learning, where learning to code is acquired from a series of trials and mistakes. As a DevMountain scholar, I have learned to do exactly that and have taken that lesson to heart till today.",

				"Since my exposure to DevMountain, I have taken on a junior role at <a href=\"https://www.lexialearning.com/\" target=\"_blank\"  class=\"paragraph-links\">Lexia Learning</a> to a full-time Software Engineer gig at <a href=\"https://newfold.com/\"    target=\"_blank\"  class=\"paragraph-links\">Newfold Digital</a>, working on enterprise-level applications used by millions of customers and internal teams."

For now, I plan to actively contribute the skills I have acquired till now on my next role and learn modern, industry-proven techniques and best practices from both experienced and newbie developers to be a more well-rounded senior engineer and a mentor."
