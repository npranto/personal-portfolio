I found that to be way more fun and practical than the college courses I was taking back then. Thus, I continued with it and pushed to learn even more on the side. Eventually, I fell in love with it so much that I took the risk of taking time off from college and fully dedicated my time to a software engineering immersive program called <a href=\\\"https://devmountain.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"  class=\\\"paragraph-links\\\">DevMountain</a>."

While I understand the importance of traditional computer science education with a heavy theoretical learning approach, I don't think it's enough for diving into real-world problems in the most effective way. We need more hands-on, practical, project-based learning, where learning to code is acquired from a series of trials and mistakes. As a DevMountain scholar, I have learned to do exactly that and have taken that lesson to heart till today."

It’s powered by Next.js (using the pages router) and Contentful CMS, allowing me to update content easily through the web application dashboard. About five years ago, I created the first version of my portfolio as a single-page application using create-react-app. Looking back, I realize I overcomplicated things by client-rendering a static site that rarely changed. In hindsight, server-side rendering or static rendering in this case has been a more practical choice, given how infrequently the content is updated. With version 5, I decided to simplify and redesign the UI and architecture to make future updates easier and more manageable. Over the past few years, I’ve experimented with different versions of the site, but this current version feels like the perfect balance. Now, I can make content updates seamlessly through the CMS, while auto-deploying changes via Netlify without needing manual code updates. I’ve also integrated end-to-end testing with Cypress to ensure the UI stays solid and bug-free as I continue to update and grow the content.",
