description: '<p>
  An utility library of functions that leverage regular
  expressions to validate different types of inputs
  </p>
  <p>
  <span class="font-semibold">Motivation:</span> Using regexes
  is very common for developers to validate inputs like email,
  zip code, or credit card number. I wanted to build a small
  utility library to verify many different types of inputs
  with regexes, so I never have to reach out to google to find
  the same, trustworthy regex every time. Currently, I do not
  have an exhaustive list of all the regexes there are, but I
  have plans to add more and more over time. Regexer is a node
  package that can be installed for both server side and
  client side use.
