				"I started my journey in web development during my first year of college as a Computer Science student.

I found that to be way more fun and practical than the college courses I was taking back then. Thus, I continued with it and pushed to learn even more on the side. Eventually, I fell in love with it so much that I took the risk of taking time off from college and fully dedicated my time to a software engineering immersive program called <a href=\"https://devmountain.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DevMountain</a>.",

				"I always believed that I was a go-getter who loves taking risks to improve and get better progressively. That's why I pursued an alternative track to higher education. While I understand the importance of traditional computer science education with a heavy theoretical learning approach, I don't think it's enough for diving into real-world problems in the most effective way. We need more hands-on, practical, project-based learning, where learning to code is acquired from a series of trials and mistakes. As a DevMountain scholar, I have learned to do exactly that and have taken that lesson to heart till today.",
