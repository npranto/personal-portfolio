Iâ€™m\n  passionate about crafting clean, responsive, reusable user\n  interfaces with modern technologies including\n  <a\n    href=\"https://reactjs.org/\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n    >React</a\n    >,\n  <a\n    href=\"https://redux.js.org/\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n    >Redux</a\n    >, and\n  <a\n    href=\"https://nextjs.org/\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n    >Next.js</a\n    >. I also love creating products that serve instant value to\n  customers.\n</p>\n<p class=\"text-base text-gray-500 my-2\">\n  Over the past few years, I had the honor of helping build a highly\n  customizable eCommerce platform as an engineer at Newfold Digital.\n  This, in return, accelerated development time and feature delivery\n  for multiple client-side teams within the organization. On the side,\n  I also built and published mini utility libraries and APIs using\n  <a\n    href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n    >\n  Node.js</a\n    >\n  for external use.\n</p>\n<p class=\"text-base text-gray-500 my-2\">\n  Currently, I am learning techniques to better architect client-side\n  applications to deliver more reliability and performance. So, if you\n  are looking for a front-end focused developer who can improve\n  developer experience, create dynamic user interfaces, and\n  collaborate effectively, feel free to\n  <a href=\"#contact\" class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\">\n  reach out!</a\n    >\n</p>",

I was learning HTML and CSS\n  for the very first time, not through a college course though, but on\n  an online learning platform called -\n  <a\n    href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n    >\n  Codeacademy</a\n    >. I found that to be way more fun and practical than the college\n  courses I was taking back then. Thus, I continued with it and pushed\n  to learn even more on the side. Eventually, I fell in love with it\n  so much that I took the risk of taking time off from college and\n  fully dedicated my time to a software engineering immersive program\n  called\n  <a\n    href=\"https://devmountain.com/\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n    >DevMountain</a\n    >.\n</p>\n<p class=\"text-base text-gray-500 my-2\">\n  I always believed that I was a go-getter who loves taking risks to\n  improve and get better progressively. That's why I pursued an\n  alternative track to higher education. While I understand the\n  importance of traditional computer science education with a heavy\n  theoretical learning approach, I don't think it's enough for diving\n  into real-world problems in the most effective way. We need more\n  hands-on, practical, project-based learning, where learning to code\n  is acquired from a series of trials and mistakes. As a DevMountain\n  scholar, I have learned to do exactly that and have taken that\n  lesson to heart till today.\n</p>\n<p class=\"text-base text-gray-500 my-2\">\n  Since my exposure to DevMountain, I have taken on a junior role at\n  <a\n    href=\"https://www.lexialearning.com/\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n    >Lexia Learning</a\n    >\n  to a full-time Software Engineer gig at\n  <a\n    href=\"https://newfold.com/\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n    >\n  Newfold Digital</a\n    >, working on enterprise-level applications used by millions of\n  customers and internal teams.\n</p>\n<h3 class=\"font-semibold mt-3\">Future Ambitions</h3>\n<p class=\"text-base text-gray-500 my-2\">\n  Of course, I still have a long way to go and I am working on getting\n  better one day at a time. For now, I plan to actively contribute the\n  skills I have acquired till now on my next role and learn modern,\n  industry-proven techniques and best practices from both experienced\n  and newbie developers to be a more well-rounded senior engineer and\n  a mentor.\n</p>"
