			"description": "<p>\n  A static personal portfolio website to showcase projects,\n  work experiences, and blogs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <span class=\"font-semibold\">Motivation:</span>\n  It&#39;s been almost 3 years since I have launched\n  <a\n    class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n    href=\"https://nsp.surge.sh/\"\n    >v1.0.0</a\n    >\n  of my personal portfolio site. At that time, I was heavily\n  involved with building single-page applications w/ React.\n  So, even for a simple static website like a portfolio, I\n  went overboard and built it as a SPA. Looking back at it, I\n  realized there was no need to complicate building static\n  websites. That can be achieved pretty easily with a few\n  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Thus, I decided to redesign\n  the UI and keep the architecture simple to make future\n  updates easy and more manageable. Unlike v1.0.0, I also\n  added end-to-end UI testing with Cypress and also set up a\n  CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automate tests and\n  deployment on code changes.\n</p>",

			"description": "<p>\n  A personal journal for keeping track of all your trades\n  online.\n</p>\n<p>\n  <span class=\"font-semibold\">Motivation:</span> A friend\n  reached out to me to ask for an application that he wants to\n  use to log daily stock trades. I found the idea fairly\n  simple to implement as it seemed very similar to any other\n  note or record tracking software. Thus, I felt the need to\n  jump on it right away. I didn&#39;t want to spend too much time\n  building out the entire application, specially handling APIs\n  and databases, so I decided to go with a firebase database\n  to store stock trades on the backend. As for user\n  authentication, firebase authentication also came in handy\n  as well. This way, I was able to focus more on the client\n  side and build a responsive, playful UI with React\n</p>\n<p>\n  <span class=\"font-semibold\">Future Plans:</span> As of\n  October 17, 2021, LogTrade\n  <a\n    class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n    href=\"https://github.com/npranto/logtrade/releases/tag/v1.0.0\"\n    >v1.0.0</a\n    >\n  is\n  <a\n    class=\"text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-500\"\n    href=\"https://616ccd47646645000896e7cb--logtrade.netlify.app/home/\"\n    >live</a\n    >\n  in production. More potential bug-fixes and feature\n  enhancements will be added pretty soon. Also, I do have\n  plans to release v2.0.0 early to mid 2022.\n</p>",

I wanted to build a small\n  utility library to verify many different types of inputs\n  with regexes, so I never have to reach out to google to find\n  the same, trustworthy regex every time. Currently, I do not\n  have an exhaustive list of all the regexes there are, but I\n  have plans to add more and more over time. Regexer is a node\n  package that can be installed for both server-side and\n  client-side use.\n</p>",
